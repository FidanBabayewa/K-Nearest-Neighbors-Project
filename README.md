# K Nearest Neighbors Project

Welcome to the KNN Project! This project involves implementing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm using a dataset. The goal is to predict a target class based on the features provided in the dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, we will be working with an artificial dataset and applying the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to make predictions. We will follow the steps outlined below to build and evaluate our KNN model.

## Steps

### 1. Import Libraries
Start by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Read the 'KNN_Project_Data.csv' file into a pandas DataFrame and check the head of the DataFrame to ensure the data is loaded correctly.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the data using a pairplot created with seaborn. The pairplot will display relationships between different features, with the hue indicated by the 'TARGET CLASS' column.

### 3. Standardize the Variables
Use the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the features. Create a scaled version of the features by fitting and transforming them using the scaler. Convert the scaled features to a DataFrame and verify that the scaling worked as expected.

### 4. Using KNN
Import the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn. Create a KNN model instance with a chosen value for 'n_neighbors' (e.g., n_neighbors=1). Fit the KNN model to the training data.

### 5. Predictions and Evaluations
Use the predict method to predict values using the trained KNN model and the testing data (X_test). Create a confusion matrix and a classification report to evaluate the performance of the KNN model.

### 6. Choosing a K Value
Implement the elbow method to determine a suitable value for 'k' (number of neighbors). Create a for loop to train various KNN models with different 'k' values and track the error_rate for each model.

### 7. Plotting the Elbow Curve
Visualize the error rates obtained from the previous step by plotting an elbow curve. This curve will help us choose the optimal 'k' value based on the point where the error rate begins to level off.

### 8. Retrain with New K Value
Select the best 'k' value based on the elbow curve analysis. Retrain the KNN model using the chosen 'k' value and assess the model's performance using the classification report and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks. By following the outlined steps, you'll gain practical experience in preprocessing data, training a KNN model, and evaluating its performance. The project's structure allows you to experiment with different 'k' values and understand the impact on the model's accuracy.
